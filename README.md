RoboChat
========

## About the Project

This is a "garage" project. The idea is to have a chat that instead of just showing
text it can say whatever you wrote to the other person. It is currently been worked
by Pedro Anibarro and myself, Jose R. de la Vega. We also have a more experienced
person that gives us some tips and helps when he can, Luis R. de la Vega. The project
started on October 2nd of 2014, and since we are students and have a lot of work we have
development meetings every Thursday, although we sometimes work on weekednds or on our
free time because we like it. Feel free to contact us.

* We store our data using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework.

## What's next?

We are currently fixing some bugs and after we have finished the basic app, we will
implement accounts, private conversations and of course, the most important thing,
an API that changes text to speach.
